# Student-Management-System
Here's a complete Java console-based project for your Student Management System with the features you requested:

✅ Unique Roll Number Validation
✅ GPA/Marks Management
✅ Student Sorting
✅ Simple Admin Login
✅ Student Profile Viewing
✅ Attendance Tracking
✅ File Save/Load Support

You can now run this project directly in your IDE. If you’d like to enhance it later with a GUI (JavaFX/Swing) or database support, I’d be happy to guide you further.
